# Random Number Generator

This is experiment creating a npm package to generate a number

## Getting Started

Check that you have node and npm installed
To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

```
node -v
```
To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:
```
npm -v
```
A note on versions
npm versions
npm is a separate project from Node.js, and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if youâ€™ve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), youâ€™ll probably need to update your npm. Luckily, npm knows how to update itself! To update your npm, type this into your terminal:
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
Execute the code in the ```test.js``` file using $ ```node ./test.js```, you should see a random number logged to the console.
